# C++17

## Overview

The latest draft for C++17 can be found [here](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/blob/master/papers/n4687.pdf).

## Features 
(NOT COMPLETED. Once this is removed, the list is complete)

* [Fold expressions](#fold-expressions)
* Structured bindings

### Fold expressions
This extends the capabilities already established by C++11's parameter packing. Fold expressions are seen (and are integral to) languages like Haskell, and it has come to C++! More details can be found on [cppreference](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/fold).


Example code [here](examples/foldexpr.cpp).
